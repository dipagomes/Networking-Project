# Networking-Project
A campus network, campus area network, corporate area network or CAN
is a computer network made up of an interconnection of local area networks (LANs) within a limited geographical area. In university campus area
networks often interconnect a variety of buildings, including administrative
buildings, academic buildings, university libraries, campus or student centers,
residence halls, gymnasiums, and other outlying structures, like conference
centers, technology centers, and training institutes. So here we have created
University Campus Networking System.
